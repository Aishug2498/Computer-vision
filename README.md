Use ocr to extract information from image and translate the information/text to another language

1. The library (if used on Windows OS) requires the tesseract.exe binary to be also present for proper installation of the library.
2. This path needs to be remembered as it would be utilized later on in the code. For most installations the path would be C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe. 

3. https://indiantechwarrior.com/how-to-install-tesseract-on-windows/  
The above link will provide information about how to install tesseract on windows

4. Path_to_tesseract means the path_to_tesseract variable which contains the path to the executable binary (tesseract.exe) that we installed in the prerequisite (this path would depend on the location where the binary is installed)
5. we can run the code on Anaconda juypter notebook, Pycharm or google colab platform. note that google colab is online platform whereaas Pycharm and juypter is not online platform we need to install these platforms to run the code.

6. I have also posted the output of code in ocr.pdf
